7,Geoff Muldaur,"GEOFF MULDAUR: Geoff Muldaur is one of the great voices and musical forces to emerge from the folk, blues and folk-rock scenes centered in Cambridge, MA and Woodstock, NY.
During the 1960’s and ’70’s, he made a series of highly influential recordings as a founding member of the Jim Kweskin Jug Band and Paul Butterfield’s Better Days, as well as collaborations with his then-wife Maria and many others such as Bonnie Raitt  and Jerry Garcia. He left the stage and recording world in the mid-1980’s for a working sabbatical but made a new name for himself composing scores for film and television. His definitive recording of “Brazil” provided the seed for – and was featured in – Terry Gilliam’s film of the same title.
Many of the biggest names on the scene are fans of the man. Bonnie Raitt says that he has always been one of her favourites and in a recent interview, Richard Thompson said: “There are only three great white blues singers and Geoff Muldaur is at least two of them.” Talking after a recent ‘live’ performance, John Sebastian said: “The Lovin’ Spoonful’s favourite singer went and got better,” while Loudon Wainwright III is on record as stating: “Geoff Muldaur was and is one of my musical heroes.”",GREEN NOTE,Sun 25th August 8:30pm,Cancelled,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9odBtqpPus', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDv7YLiKJ_M', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9odBtqpPus', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDv7YLiKJ_M', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9odBtqpPus', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDv7YLiKJ_M']"

11,Erin Enderlin + Kayla Ray,"Nashville singer-songwriter ERIN ENDERLIN has a way of turning a song or even just a thought into an outstretched hand to the lonely or ashamed. While she first turned heads as a godsend to those aching for an artist with some golden-era country backbone, Enderlin’s acclaimed 2017 record Whiskeytown Crier firmly cemented her as something more. She’s a literary songwriter and superb vocal stylist with a knack for sharply drawn––and often sad––characters. Backsliders, avengers, lovers, and victims––they’re all swapping forlorn tales on the collection, which is a fresh take on the concept album set in a small Southern town.Enderlin was named a member of the 2018 CMT Next Women of Country, a recipient of the Arkansas Country Music Awards Songwriter and Album of the Year recognitions, and runner-up to Jason Isbell in the Best Singer-Songwriter field in the Nashville Scene’s touchstone Best of Nashville issue. Already a go-to writer for stars having penned mega country hits such as Alan Jackson’s “Monday Morning Church,” Lee Ann Womack’s “Last Call,” Luke Bryan’s “You Don’t Know Jack,” and a host of other songs for Randy Travis, Joey+Rory, and more. Enderlin continues to add marquee cuts to her catalog including, “The Bar’s Getting Lower” recorded by Reba for her recent album Stronger Than the Truth. Terri Clark also featured five Enderlin-written gems on her Raising the Bar album. She makes her London debut at the Green Note. Growing up in the Waco,Texas area, Kayla began seeking any opportunity to perform. Kayla played off and on with the legendary fiddle player Johnny Gimble and his family band simple called, “The Gimbles”.

13,Roxy Rawson + Mondrian + Lunatraktors,"‘Like Tom’s Diner crossed with Nellie McKay. Gorgeous minimal percussion and her joy shine bright. You can’t help but revel in the creativity of Ms Rawson’s occasionally wild, sometimes tender composition’ Planet Sound Falling squarely into the anti-folk category by way of a manipulated, punk-y violin, ROXY RAWSON has been a cult presence on the Parisian and London music scenes with her unique blend of impish violin vocals and classical/ jazz influence. Now based in San Francisco Bay and ready to release her long awaited second full length album, this is a singer songwriter whose flair for the alternative demands the world’s attention.Born into a Mormon community in Hitchin, UK, she was introduced to music through Church hymns, but first found her feet in Paris where she studied violin and piano. Surrounding herself with local jazz performers, she joined several orchestras and spent much of her time studying classical and baroque styles of music. Rawson found her own voice however, developing a unique vocal style through singing ‘jumping jazz intervals’ on the streets of the French capital. She also joined an African Choir, adding yet another multi-cultural layer to her sound.MONDRIAN is a new live project from long term friends and collaborators Stu Barter (Left with Pictures, Stats) and Tom Walker. Using an array of modular electronics, looped vocals and live strings, Mondrian create multi-layered, longform, improvisatory pop music. Combining the percussive and choreographic talents of Carli Jefferson with the four octave range and haunting overtones of trans folk singer Clair Le Couteur, Lunatraktors use the basic ingredients of body and voice to conjure up expansive, unexpected spaces. While the material is traditional, the themes of institutional violence, forced migration and personal hardship that echo through the songs are strikingly contemporary. The overall feel is of defiant, transnational protest laced with dark humour – an urgent political necessity in Brexit Britain.",GREEN NOTE,Fri 30th August 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p9Gtd6NWEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1u8tXeUknk']"
14,Deelee Dubé,"DEELEE DUBÉ: “A beguiling soulfulness”  Jazz Times
Winner of the 2016 Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition, Deelee Dubé (pronounced Doo-bay, accented “é”) is a one of the most gifted vocalists to have emerged from the London scene in many years. Embodying a stellar African musical lineage, the eclectic tastes of a London upbringing and a deep love and respect for the jazz tradition, Deelee possesses what Jazz Times called ‘a warm tone, genuine blues feeling and easy rhythmic authority.’Deelee’s late father was the famed South African jazz pianist Jabu Nkosi; her grandfather another legendary figure from the country’s music scene, saxophonist and bandleader Zacks (Isaac) Nkosi. Deelee was brought up with music all around her, and formed her first band at the age of 14. She attended the BRIT School for arts and music, and received formal voice sessions under Anton Browne later studying under vocalist Clare Foster, and forming the first of many musical relationships with jazz pianist Roland Perrin. She has most recently been under the private tutelage of Jazz artist and teacher Rachel Gould and Renato D’Aiello who also acts as her mentor.A songwriter as well as a singer, Deelee has had her work reach the semi-finals of the UK Song writing (UKSC) Contest. She also teaches as a freelance voice coach and singing teacher, conducting one-to-one sessions under her business ‘Vocal InsightTM’, based around the Estill Voice Training System.

20,Leslie Stevens + Matt The Electrician,"Awarded “Best Country Singer” in the LA Weekly’s 2018 Best Of, you can feel LESLIE STEVENS’ voice reach the nails in the doorframe. She spins a high craft, with songs about donkeys and drinking and driving in heaven— and just when you thought she might light your living room on fire with a giggle, she’ll blast you through the skylight into outer space.  The LA Times calls her “one of the city’s best” and Chris Ziegler (LA Record) explains that Leslie has “the kind of voice you’ll realize you’ve been waiting to hear since forever.” She’s sung on records by Jim James, Father John Misty, Jonathan Wilson, and live with Joe Walsh, Jackson Browne, and John Fogerty, as well as other musicians not beginning with the letter “J.”  Brave lyrically and vulnerable in spirit: Leslie never shies away from laying down what’s what, if only to leave a mark on the most golden part of your soul. Despite the name, MATT THE ELECTRICIAN is no longer an electrician, focusing instead on a music career that has spanned the course of two decades, a dozen records, and thousands of shows.“Matt is a modern equivalent to prime Loudon Wainwright III and John Gorka with the tale-spinning gifts of Spalding Gray rolled into a soft spoken, tattoo adorned package.” – Jambase",GREEN NOTE,Tue 3rd September 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w7vC0nMg4Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w7vC0nMg4Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w7vC0nMg4Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w7vC0nMg4Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5w7vC0nMg4Y']"

22,Amy Speace,"A modern folksinger whose music nods to the genre’s 1970s glory days, AMY SPEACE has spent two decades chronicling the high marks, heartbreaks, and hard roads of a life logged on the road. She’s been a tireless traveler, chasing the dream from the coffeehouses of New York City to larger stages across the globe. Along the way, she’s built an international audience without the help of a major label, relying instead upon a touring schedule whose milestones include the Glastonbury Festival, NPR’s Mountain Stage, and a yearly average of 150 shows. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne finds Speace focusing on the other side of that so-called dream. The real side, filled with an ever-shifting balance of struggle and joy. Produced by longtime collaborator Neilson Hubbard and recorded during the final weeks of Speace’s pregnancy with her first son, Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne captures Amy Speace at her most nakedly honest, with sparsely-decorated songs that double down on her larger-than-life voice and detail-rich songwriting. It’s an album about the colliding of dreams and reality, full of characters making sense of their lives when something is lost and then found. Really, it’s an album about the trials and triumphs of an artist’s journey — a journey that’s no longer focused upon the destination, but upon the actual trip itself.Discovered and mentored by folk-pop icon Judy Collins during the early 2000s, Speace left her career as a classically-trained Shakespearean actress and, instead, kicked off a string of acclaimed albums, including Songs for Bright Street, The Killer in Me, and How to Sleep in a Stormy Boat. Championed by The New York Times, NPR and other taste-making outlets for her solo work, she received further acclaim as a member of Applewood Road, a harmony-heavy trio whose self-titled album became a critical success in the UK, earning a five-star review from The London Sunday Times.Years before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Speace was one of the genre’s earliest champions, mixing the best parts of American roots music — gospel, alt-country, folk, classic pop — into her own songs. Me And The Ghost Of Charlemagne follows in that diverse tradition, but it also shines its light on a new Amy Speace: a clear-eyed, reenergized songwriter who’s done with chasing things that don’t matter…but isn’t anywhere close to being done with her art.  Support from KIRSTY MERRYN.",GREEN NOTE,Wed 4th September 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsfXiAUTKsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mdl6bcwG18']"
23,The Grahams,"PLEASE NOTE: This event will be taking place at our alternative home for the evening: THE WATER RATS (London WC1X 8BZ)THE GRAHAMS: The Grahams, traveling troubadours, always itching for the next ride out of town guitars and whiskey in tow. In 2013 their wanderlust took them down the Mississippi to the Atchafalaya swamp in Louisiana, then in 2015 it was the American rails, and a cross-country odyssey that resulted in not only a new album but an award-winning film. In 2017, with the country reeling from a seemingly unstoppable vortex of disorientation, The Grahams embarked on perhaps their most adventurous journey yet, pointing their Harleys west to explore the “Mother Road” and the concept of “real” America with the eccentric and notorious characters who live and work in the strange and mysterious world that is Route 66. What they discovered was both heartening and heartbreaking, an America torn, but aching to come together, the culmination of decades of manhandling of the so called American Dream.As is typical of the Grahams this dusty excursion begat a fountain of inspiration, the results of which are, so far, a new feature length documentary film and accompanying soundtrack, with contributions from some of Nashville’s finest musician, including Elizabeth Cook, Aaron Lee Tasjan, Dylan Leblanc, Chuck Mead, Andrew Combs, and many more. Love & Distortion is not a travel guide or a musical biopic, this documentary, which follows The Grahams down Route 66, is an unconventional narrative weaving in and out of moments and realities that can be found in the various sub-cultures of America’s Main Street.Love & Distortion, the film and soundtrack, along with a brand-new studio album currently being recorded with producers Richard Swift (The Arcs, The Black Keys, The Shins) and Dan Molad (Lucius, JD McPherson) will will be the twin carbs on the snarling machine that will drive The Grahams forward in 2019.“articulate, poetic and deeply moving” 4* – Country Music People“Alyssa has a great voice, crystal clear, full of fire and passion perfectly complimented by Doug on dobro and vocals.” 5* – The Irish Post“A dynamic Americana duo who’ve married their love of adventure with a desire to build on foundations laid by their musical predecessors.” – Americana UK“Formulaic country music is something their talents, if not their pride, would allow them to do, but instead they choose to go their own unique way, something deserving of huge applause.

John Showman is rightly recognised as one of the most talented of the new old-time-style composers having spent a lifetime tapping into the source, Chris Coole is a well-established banjo player and songwriter with a considerable pedigree around the World, and bassman Max Heineman has earned himself the kind of plaudits normally reserved for those who are much longer in the tooth.
You’ll feel the energy of three passionate musicians playing the bejesus out of those instruments and loving every minute.
In their native Canada, they are recognised as the best, and the band triumphed at 2018’s MerleFest where the discerning audience knows ‘stand-out’ from more-of-the-same.

34,Arkansas Dave,"ARKANSAS DAVEIt’s a romantic cliché to find an escape in music and the blues, but living that life is a different matter. Ask Dave about growing up in a broken home, with fundamental Christianity on one side, and crippling drug-addiction on the other, and you can see in his eyes that this is no easy ride, and that at times music really was his only friend.
After High School, Arkansas Dave played in bands, funding his music with a succession of jobs where he had to find his feet quickly – from bus boy to assembly-worker in a trash-bag factory.
His wake up call came at the edge of a breakdown with a cataclysmic weekend epiphany. He headed home for a rare visit, and was persuaded to play a few songs to his family. The response he got from his grandfather sent his mind racing, only for him to find out the next week that his grandfather had died 24 hours later.
Determined to clean himself up, and sort his life, Arkansas Dave enrolled on an audio engineering course at Media Tech in Austin Texas, driving into town with a trailer loaded with all his possessions, ‘like something out of the Beverly Hillbillies’.
And that’s where everything changed – the college was housed at that time in the famous Arlyn Studios, home to sessions from Willie Nelson, Neil Young and Ray Charles. Dave with his musical co-horts took the night shift at the studios – laying down tracks and learning the ropes.A succession of bands followed, picking up a strong local following around Austin. The final part of his musical education saw Dave touring North America as a member of old bluesman Guitar Shorty’s band, where he learned ‘what it took to be a professional musician’
Fast forward to 2016 and Dave has written the album he’s always wanted to create – a wide ranging blues-rock based record that tells the story of his life, but resonates with all of us.The project just needed one more ingredient, so enter the Swampers, the legendary Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. In a blistering eight-day recording session at Fame Studios the band laid down the backing tracks, and Dave returned to Arlyn to complete the vocals.
So the next chapter of Dave’s life is about to be written as he pulls his band together and takes his album out on the road – this time on a road that he’s building….“Honest Americana, Blues and Rock n Roll that reflects the spirit of the South.”",THE BASEMENT BAR,Mon 9th September 8:00pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/WAiUg64R8Qg']"

37,Jake Morrell + Megan O’Neill,"JAKE MORRELL could have come straight out of Nashville, or even from the Californian sunshine, as his music suggests; but Jake is from Norfolk, England!Jake was ‘discovered’ by Dermot O’Leary, who featured him on his Radio 2 Show. One influential listener just so happened to be Glastonbury boss Emily Eavis, who immediately asked Jake to perform at the iconic festival.Jake recorded his debut single with London based producer Brett Shaw (Florence & The Machine, The Kooks & Dry the River). The song entitled “Wire and Thorns” reached No.2 in the iTunes country charts on the first day of release. This led to Jake being invited to perform at this year’s Country 2 Country festival, where he premiered his first major single, the appropriately titled ‘Englishman (Trying to Write a Country Song)’ – written with the Grammy-winning writer/producer Kipper.The reaction to the song put Jake firmly in line as one of the country’s favourite new male artists in the genre.This lead to a string of both solo and band shows and festivals throughout the summer with Jake showing himself to be as irresistible as a solo act as he is with his band.The most exciting new development, however, is the new music that Jake has now recorded to launch the next phase of his career. This is led by a joyous forthcoming single, ‘Home’, written and produced with Rolling Stones keyboardist, Matt Clifford. With an evocative mix of Mumford & Sons, Eagles and even Springsteen, ‘Home’ is the definitive track that firmly stamps Jake Morrell’s name across the UK country music scene. Irish born singer – songwriter MEGAN O’NEILL is currently working on her second full-length, studio album, set for full release in 2020. This much anticipated record follows her last album release, ‘Ghost of You’ (June 2018) which hit #1 on the iTunes singer/songwriter charts in the UK and Ireland.To date Megan has toured the UK, Ireland, US and Germany. She has performed at private Oscars’ parties in LA alongside Gavin James (on personal invite from JJ Abrams) and has had her song ‘Don’t You’ featured on ABC’s hit TV Show ‘Nashville’ (Season 3).Prior to her album ‘Ghost of You’; Megan released two EP’s: ‘Coming Home’ (2015) – produced by Philip Magee (The Script, Kodaline) and ‘Stories to Tell’ (2017) – produced by Guy Fletcher (Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler). She also released a single under Decca Records in collaboration with Ben Earle (The Shires) – ‘Can’t Put a Price on That’ (2016).Megan is an integral artist in the currently booming UK Country Music Scene, being termed “one of the rising stars” by uDiscover (2018). In 2018, she performed at every UK Country Music Festival including Country-2-Country (at the 02, London), Black Deer Festival, The Long Road Festival and Nashville Meets London’s series of events. She has been twice chosen as one of Timeout Magazine’s ‘Rising Stars in Country Music’.This year sees Megan taking the main stage at the British Country Music Festival and Dixie Fields Festival – two brand new festivals launching in 2019 due to the demand for more country music events in the UK.  ",GREEN NOTE,Wed 11th September 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/7IzWzjcDmsU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/akD6JsTAf-Y']"

50,Creations Free jazz/improv,"Creations Nights are an exploration of the possibilities of freely improvised music. Each month, an established group from London’s lively free improv scene is invited to perform a set, followed by an open session where musicians mix up in small groups to create new music on-the-spot.They may draw on many different influences from jazz, folk, classical, electronica and other genres, and explore a variety of familiar and unfamiliar sound-worlds. Always a engaging and original evening, with leading players from the scene popping in to make music!Tonight featuring Elliot Galvin (piano).ELLIOT GALVIN: “He reminds me of the young Django Bates, and the impression Django made on me in the 1980s – great improv chops, strong character as a player and a composer, evident love of the jazz tradition without wanting to repeat the past, very English sense of humor. He’s the kind of artist you always want to stay tuned in to, because you know he’s going to keep on coming up with surprises.” – John Fordham (The Guardian)​Elliot Galvin is one of the rising stars of UK jazz. A superbly gifted composer and pianist, whose maverick imagination and magpie like ability to blend a disparate world of influences into his own unique musical vision has seen him compared to Django Bates although in truth he sounds like no one except himself.Elliot is a prolific composer and has been comissioned by a number of Ensembles, Dance Companies, Theatre Groups and Festivals including the London Sinfonietta, Ligeti String Quartet, St. John Smith’s Square, The London Jazz festival, The RESOLUTION! Dance Festival at The Place and the Theatre Company Cut Tongues. He works regularly with multi-media and in 2014 put on a multi-media installation piece at the Turner Contemporary Gallery, which consisted of live performance, interactive sound sculptures and film.​He performs regularly as a soloist and is a key member of the Mercury nominated Band Dinosaur. He has recently began a duo project with the renowned saxophonist Binker Golding (one half of Binker and Moses), with whom he released the critically acclaimed album EX Nihilio on Byrd Out records in February 2019. ",THE BASEMENT BAR,Thu 19th September 8:00pm,£ 8.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeZL9qyzbk0', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaFiwGZ_otI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTvla5E8IaM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYLYeQiZ6-4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiNbDXJhxjY', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWN2VmiS-0w']"
51,Smith & Brewer,"New Roots presents… SMITH & BREWER.Taking influence from the The Everly Brothers to Simon & Garfunkel, John Martyn to the countrified Grateful Dead, Smith & Brewer combine classic close harmony style with superbly honed songwriting craft and stunningly virtuosic guitar playing to produce a brilliantly accessible roots sound.‘Jaw-dropping!’ Americana UK‘Two beautifully blended voices…a modern-day Simon & Garfunkel’. Fatea MagazineBen Smith and Jimmy Brewer met at an event organised by Joan Armatrading for the acts she had chosen to support her on her 2015 tour. Although they originally planned to just write together, they soon realised that their playing styles and voices complemented each other and they started playing together after their inaugural gig supporting Joan Armatrading in front of a thousand-strong crowd.Since then, they have played together all over the UK, notably as the support act to 10cc and Ralph McTell on their 2018 U.K tours, at Fairport’s Cropredy Convention 2018, the 2018 Cambridge Folk Festival and the UK Americana Awards Showcase in 2017 and 2019,, as well as at the AmericanaFest in Nashville in 2017. They also contributed backing vocals to Ralph McTell’s New Album, which was produced by Tony Visconti.They have recently finished work on their debut album, Another Shade Of, which was recorded at Coltsfoot, a friend’s barn which they converted into a studio for a week. This allowed them to record together live both as an acoustic duo and a full band. The tracks were mixed by Ben and Jimmy and mastered by David Mitson (noted for his work with Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson and more).Jimmy’s inspiration for his song-writing career came from his desire to move beyond his rural upbringing and follow in the footsteps of the musicians who shaped his interest in playing as a young child, including The Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley and The Everley Brothers.Ben has also been writing and playing from an early age, and despite his original desire to learn the banjo being thwarted, he threw himself into the guitar in an effort to emulate his musical heroes: BB King, John Martyn, Jerry Reed and the Grateful Dead. NEW ROOTS is committed to promoting events that shine a light on up and coming talent in the UK alt-folk scene. Its committed to providing artists with an environment that is sympathetic to what they do, giving musicians the respect they and their music deserves – for this reason we ask for no talking and no use of mobile phones while artists are performing.

53,The Maes,"Multi-award-winning Melbourne contemporary folk outfit, THE MAES (formerly The Mae Trio) is the brainchild of sisters Maggie and Elsie Rigby.  Born into the arms of the Folk music community in Australia, both sisters were side of stage at their first folk festival when they were four weeks old and have been absorbing and exploring folk music since that time.The Maes’ latest, self-titled record set for release in May 2019 is a return to the sisters’ folk music roots. Gentle, intimate and conversational, the album is an unadorned showcase of Maggie and Elsie’s superb songwriting as well as honest, relaxed and stunning vocal and instrumental performances.The album was born on a two-month tour of Europe and North America in 2018 shortly after the band changed its name from The Mae Trio to The Maes after the departure of founding member Anita Hillman. The sisters started the tour with a recording session in Canada, intending to make a four track EP. Fired up by the changes in the band, inspired and bursting with new music they kept looking for new recording opportunities as the tour progressed. By the end of the tour they had two tracks from Nova Scotia, Canada, two songs from the Isle of Mull in Scotland, two songs from different studios in Ireland and four songs recorded in their home town of Melbourne.The album features production from top roots music producers from around the world including, Daniel Ledwell (Oh Pep!, Jenn Grant, Good Lovelies), John Fitzgerald (Christy Moore, Crooked Still, Lisa Hannigan) and Brendon Love (Teskey Brothers). The album also features cello and harmony vocals by award-winning Brisbane musician, Monique Clare who regularly tours with The Maes.“This is the album we never really intended to make” says Maggie (banjo, guitar, vocals) “we were struck by the ease and serendipity with which it came together, like it was just ready to come out of us. I love this record, I’ve never made anything that feels so comfortable and honest. I also reckon it’s our strongest collection of songs to date”.“We were deep into making this album before we knew we were making an album. There is a beautiful absence of pressure and self-consciousness that happened as a result; like the opposite of having a camera pointing at you while you arrange your face into a ‘normal and happy expression’. We were truly playing in the studio. In a few senses.”  ~ Elsie (mandolin, violin, vocals)Their latest release follows on from their sophomore album, Take Care Take Cover, which was recorded in Nashville by Grammy nominated producer/engineer Erick Jaskowiak (The Waifs, Crooked Still, Darrell Scott) and featuring some of that music town’s finest roots musicians. The record won them the Age, Music Victoria Folk/Roots Album of the Year in 2017 as well as rave reviews in Australia and overseas.Since 2014, The Maes have been full time touring in Australia and overseas, winning over audiences with their striking songwriting, intricate instrumental arrangements and stunning vocal harmonies. The band’s touring history includes a list of some of the worlds largest and most prestigious music festivals such as, the Woodford and Port Fairy Folk Festivals in Australia, The Edmonton and Vancouver Folk Festivals in Canada, Cambridge Folk and Celtic Connections festivals in the UK and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in the USA.",GREEN NOTE,Fri 20th September 8:30pm,£ 12.50,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpBx8CDheEk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz7OmFfl5lU']"

What’s more, he still manages and is very much friends with the fishermen.Coming soon is Wild Rose, an acclaimed British musical drama starring Jessie Buckley and Julie Waters about a singer from Glasgow who dreams of country music stardom, for which Ian has co-written some of the music.Now he’s returning to the stage to play some of his songs that have graced the charts and so many more that haven’t. His finely-honed everyman tales and self-deprecating musical outings are interspersed with tall tales from the music business, life, love and the universe, some of which will grace the pages of his eagerly awaited (by some) musical memoir/manual.Let’s face it, there’s plenty of material to draw on. As well as co-writing Sandi Thom’s number one single ‘I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker’ and the lead song in the long running West End musical ‘Dreamboats and Petticoats’, Ian has written songs for many other artists, from folk acts such as the Fisherman’s Friends and Show Of Hands, to pop stars like D-Side, Simon Webbe and Pixie Lott, he even had dance hits with Drumsound & Bassline Smith and Don Diablo.In the last year Ian’s songs have played on BBC Radio 1, 2, 4 and 5. He is working on something for BBC Radio 3, once he has mastered the nose flute.On stage Ian has supported 10cc, Steve Harley, Rita Coolidge, Julie Felix, Martin Simpson and Martin Carthy and has played many festivals including Glastonbury, Cornbury, Purbeck and Greenwich. His proudest moment, however, is performing ‘The Five Foot Two Inch Giant’, an anthem to his wife, on the Model Village Stage at Wimborne Minster Folk Festival… he could make this stuff up, but he doesn’t have to!Ian W Brown is the only known pig farmer to be nominated for an Ivor Novello Award.",GREEN NOTE,Sun 22nd September 8:30pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bx0nlPC_Gs', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jttnjxZpE']"
58,"Celebrating Mitsakis, with Plastikes Karekles","Born in Istanbul in 1921, Giorgos Mitsakis started his career as a bouzouki player in 1937. Mitsakis career, both as a songwriter and a composer, took off after the Second World War. For Mitsakis song writing was telling a story and he was known not only for his beautiful and catchy melodies but for writing his own lyrics for his songs and other composers’ too, such as Zabetas. He was a composer who had one foot in the old music of Rebetiko and one always looking forward with more influences from jazz, latin and any other styles that great musician absorbed. Tonight we will be presenting some of his classics but also lesser known songs that deserve to have an equal status as some of the most beautiful songs ever written, not just by Mitsakis, but in this whole  genre.

Her vocals seem to channel the spirit of Janis Joplin and Grace Slick whilst also acknowledging her all time favourite Alanis Morissette.Working with well know NI producer/songwriter/musician Michael Mormecha (Drums) and Zach Trouton (Keys), the threesome deliver a fresh, edgy and original live performance.Her first single Dangerous blissfully blends gently strummed acoustic guitars with soaring string arrangements and rich electric licks. It picked up plays across BBC Radio Ulster and spot plays on Bob Harris’s Radio 2 show. “She came on stage with all the attitude of Joan Jett. In feathered bra-top, leather-look leggings, war paint and biker jacket, this girl is ballsy. And she has the voice to match” Mandela Hall Review, Gigging NI June 2018“She has already been compared to Grace Slick and Janis Joplin, possibly because of the power of her voice, the free abandon with which she sings so naturally and her bohemian look. Tonight, many of the songs could have been lesser known songs of Fleetwood Mac and her gutsy, dreamy, melodic vocals are reminiscent of the legendary Stevie Nicks” National Rock Review, Feb 2018“The biggest and best surprise of the entire weekend was Amy Montgomery This lady has a huge voice with phenomenal power and she wasted no time in getting the crowd dancing. Playing as part of three piece who rotated between drums, guitar and keyboards, Montgomery didn’t give you the time or space to draw breath” Stendhal Festival Review, Aug 2018“Astounding voice alert, Amy is a great sonic explorer in the tradition of Janis Joplin and John Martyn” BBC NI Across The Line",PAPER DRESS VINTAGE,Wed 25th September 8:30pm,£ 8.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPWT4NM8PXM?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/tizwAJL7INI?feature=oembed']"

A new double album ‘Love in the Time of Florida’ has just been released on vinyl, CD, stream and download and follows on from his critically acclaimed first album ‘Out of Time’, that sold out at Rough Trade in only a few weeks and was described by Richard Smirke as “a gorgeously rich slice of crystalline pop that evokes classic records by the Walker Brothers, Love, and Burt Bacharach”.He has been ably supported by Lauren Laverne, Mark Radcliffe, Stuart Maconie and Chris Hawkins on BBC Radio 6 Music, John Kennedy on Radio X, and was chosen by Geoff Lloyd on Absolute Radio as his Record of the Week.He is blessed to have a group of musicians that are prepared to follow him wherever he goes.

Originally they assumed this was a one-off project but after touring Italy in 2016 this side project evolved into a solid band.In 2017 they spent time in 2500-year-old-caves in the Italian city of Osimo, writing and recording Heart Of The Cave.

Top vocalist Nikki Lamborn describes Suzanne as a “cross between Bette Midler, Joan Rivers and every single female wild child you have ever met from the vaudeville scene!” Sophie Parkin says, “Suzanne puts on a great show.. if you ever enjoyed George Melly see it as a modern female version.”Gorgeous George is a classically trained pianist who, when not playing his own style of honky tonk, can be found accompanying young prima ballerinas, opera singers and even orchestras.Together they are Bawdy Blues Suz & Gorgeous George!About the dirty blues:
This is a style of music made popular in the 20s & 30s when sexy and witty songs were all the rage. Some can be traced back to vaudeville while others were probably first aired in the brothels and speakeasies of the time.

Music starts 8pm. **It takes a special blend of musical flair to create memorable songs of yesteryear! Songs with a hint of contemporary—dosed with uncontrolled laughter, deep-rooted couplets and sudden, impromptu shifts—that speak to familiar rhythms of the past. Welcome to the original musical stylings of DE TEMPS ANTAN!Éric Beaudry, David Boulanger and Pierre-Luc Dupuis have been exploring and performing time-honoured melodies from the stomping grounds of Quebec’s musical past. Using fiddle, accordion, harmonica, guitar, bouzouki and a number of other instruments, our three virtuosos blend boundless energy with the unmistakable joie de vivre found only in traditional Quebec music. In fact, the only thing missing from this magnificent musical blend is you! So come enjoy an evening unlike any other with De Temps Antan.ÉRIC BEAUDRY was first exposed to traditional Quebec music in Saint-Côme, a village in Quebec’s Lanaudière region. Raised by a family entrenched in music, he began singing and playing guitar at the age of 10. In 1992, he unleashed his musical ambitions on local audiences by founding La Galvaude, followed-up later by Ni Sarpe Ni Branche and Norouet. Éric’s passion for music also helped foster an interest in song, which led to several awards including a 2002 Prix Mnémo for his role in producing the album Musique gaspésienne, featuring violinist Édouard Richard. In 2003, hot on the heels of this success, Éric became a member of La Bottine Souriante. Éric’s love of music also spurred a passion for enlightening others and, following the completion of a Bachelor of Arts in pop guitar and jazz, Éric began teaching traditional music at Joliette’s CEGEP régional de Lanaudière in 2002. Wherever he performs, Éric’s rich vocal range and unquestionable talent on stringed instruments—guitar, mandolin and bouzouki—guarantee a rousing performance for all.DAVID BOULANGER was born in Saint-Hubert, in Montérégie, David starts to play the violin at eight years old. It is during his teenage years that he finds a passion for Québec traditional music. Always increasing, this passion leads David on the big professional stages at the beginning of his 20s with La Part du Quêteux, a band with which he records two album including one that was rewarded as « Best Album – Traditional » at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.  Later, he joins the epic Québec trad big band La Bottine Souriante, the two international projects Maja & David and COEFF 4 and recently, he gathers with his long time friends in De Temps Antan. David is also acknowledged for his music composition that can be heard in « Timber! » from Cirque Alfonse and for the original sound track of « Quand ferme l’Usine », a movie from the director Simon Rodrigue. Being a true passionate about Québec traditional music, and wanting to share his knowledge about it, he caries a unique repertoire that one can hear wherever David goes.PIERRE-LUC DUPUIS was born in Louiseville, in Quebec’s Mauricie region, and hails from a lineage where traditional music was always at the forefront of daily life. Although he began singing with his family at a very young age, Pierre-Luc was somewhat of a late musical bloomer, taking up the accordion at 18! But what he lacked in experience he made up for in determination. At 19, he founded Les Langues Fourchures, with whom he recorded his first album in 2001. For the next 4 years, he helped the band pay its dues and make its mark throughout Quebec and, in 2003, he joined La Bottine Souriante, one of the province’s best-known music groups. Since then, he’s wowed audiences from Dublin to Porto and Budapest to Melbourne with his unique humour and warmhearted charisma. Since ending his journey with La Bottine Souriante in 2008, Pierre-Luc has devoted himself to his true love—De Temps Antan. ",THE OLD QUEEN'S HEAD,Sun 6th October 8:00pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/5J_gB5p2Uso']"

90,Dave Giles,"Up until their split in the middle of 2010, Dave was the guitarist in a large underground indie band and his sudden change in course came as a shock to the bands fanbase. Not only were followers upset over the breakdown of the band but sceptical over the concept of Dave being a one man act. However, due to his reputation of being the cheeky and charismatic one in the band, many gave him a chance, and his debut seven track EP “The First Seven” was launched in October 2010 with a sold out show at The Barfly in Camden, released (as with all of his material) by his own record label “Cheeky Chimp Records Ltd”. Since then he has toured the UK numerous times as well as tours of Ireland and Australia and numerous releases.Being an artist in the 21st century definitely has its advantages for unsigned artists. Various social medias such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube offered Dave the communication with the public that he so desperately needed at the time. Being able to promote his music, his gigs and in general, himself to his current as well as potential followers worked outstandingly well for Dave. People took a shine to his openness, his raw song writing skills as well as his interest in others. Dave Giles is a rare artist who spends a lot more time with his fans than just inviting them to gigs.Dave’s musical style is casual and slightly, yet wonderfully juvenile. Drawing inspiration from idol, Billy Bragg, Dave’s music is a form of folk, acoustic rock with his own twist.Always the shepherd and never the sheep, Dave’s performance on stage is always unpredictable and innovative. Equipped with a sharp wit, props and quirky songs, Dave knows how to put on a show. Whether he is prancing around bare foot (a common trait of the Essex boy) or gathering the audience to sit on the floor, in a circle around him, Dave always manages to keep an audience on their toes (or in some circumstances, not).Basically, Dave isn’t one of those stylish, good looking singers.",GREEN NOTE,Tue 8th October 8:30pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LRoOeeA-Ds']"

For the next project, they have recorded a full set.This is no museum piece. In keeping with the folk tradition, the songs have been revised and re invigorated whilst staying true to the heart of the stories.The project began with a very simple premise; to rediscover, explore and celebrate the ballads that had been such a strong influence throughout Bedford’s childhood. It’s only the most vital works that can survive nearly three centuries as living, still valid pieces and the Appalachian ballads are certainly that.Greatly aided by the marvellous Shirley Collins, who generously donated her time, encouragement and research materials, and by Folk Award winner Ben Walker on production and multi instrumental duties, the material was chosen, rehearsed and recorded live in the summer and autumn of 2018 in Brighton. With a cast that also included Justin Currie, Rory McLeod and Lisa Knapp, the album moulds influences from England, Scotland and South East USA to stir the great melting pot of folk and roots styles.Launching officially at home of folk music Cecil Sharp House in London on June 5th, the project will then tour throughout the UK in 2019. With new arrangements and the power of Bedford’s evocative voice, these legendary songs continue their transatlantic voyage.‘A partnership that is complementary in every respect’ Songlines Magazine

94,Jeffrey Martin + Anna Tivel,"** PLEASE NOTE: This show will take place at our alternative home for the evening: THE OLD QUEENS HEAD, 44 Essex Road, N1 8LN. Doors open 7.30pm. Music starts 8pm. ** Although he was an accomplished and fully engaged English teacher, for JEFFREY MARTIN music (and the tour life) was a constant raccoon scratching at the back door. He spent nights on end sitting up in bed, and then sitting on the front porch, staring off into the dark, wondering if he could bear to leave teaching to go on tour full time. Eventually his brain caught up with what his guts had known for months. With tears in his eyes he announced to his students that he wouldn’t be back the following year, and that he didn’t feel right hollering at them to chase their dreams at all cost if he wasn’t going to do the same. Jeffrey Martin tours full time now. He is always making music, and he is always coming through your town. He misses teaching like you might miss a good old friend who you know you’ll meet again. Jeffrey has put out bunches of music since 2009, but he’s most proud of the more recent stuff. He’s fortunate to be a part of the great and loving family that is Fluff and Gravy Records in Portland, OR.“One Go Around,” from the autumn of 2017, is his 3rd full length album. He currently lives in Portland, Oregon but feels lately that it has become a secret that someone figured out how to monetize. And since he has no money of any kind, everything beautiful about the city is marred by the quiet ticking of a countdown toward the day that he’ll have to find somewhere to live that doesn’t require a steady bleeding fortune.“Jeffrey Martin… might be the best songwriter in Portland” – Portland Mercury“He’s an incredibly rare find among today’s glut of singer-songwriters: a songwriter whose songs are immediately affecting. These are the kind of songs that can change you.”- Devon Leger, No Depression  ANNA TIVEL’s wide-eyed celestial folk songs belong in a similar ballpark with Anais Mitchell, Gregory Alan Isakov and Laura Veirs, where gentle picking plucks among occasionally unconventional sounds and a gorgeous voice tells stories of life in a world of natural wonders. The resulting music is incredibly honest, lyric-driven, and deeply affecting.An internationally touring artist with a deep love of quiet stories, Anna is beginning to carve a place for herself in the songwriting world. She was a winner at last year’s Kerrville Songwriting Contest, and has shared the stage with heroes and friends like Gregory Alan Isakov, Shook Twins, Anais Mitchell, Jefferson Hamer, Peter Mulvey, Matt the Electrician, Devon Sproule, Darlingside, Steve Poltz, Jeffrey Martin and more.Her newest album, Small Believer is her best work to date, a series of quietly dazzling vignettes in which she digs deep into the ordinary and finds special people lurking.“Everything here is testament to her storytelling gifts (she’s been likened to Steinbeck and I suspect she may have a novel or short stories collection in her) with her finely drawn characters and observations of an emotional life that ranges from defiance to regret, joy to sadness.”- Folk Radio“Anna Tivel’s voice is haunting, exhibiting the timbre of a precocious child, whispering to a teddy bear underneath the covers.” – The Bluegrass Situation“To be sure, these are organic songs that freely reveal the poetry of the mind, heart and soul, the sharp imagery of the world translated into sound, and both the simple and complex things represented sentimentally and at length.” – No Depression“Portland songwriter Anna Tivel is a favourite over at Hearth. She’s a deft, clever songwriter with a knack for observing the small, subtle beauties of our lives.” – Kithfolk ",THE OLD QUEEN'S HEAD,Thu 10th October 8:00pm,£ 12.50,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/thys54BFTkE', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv35WtHdAJ4']"

This is no lazy pastiche, no dressing up box. They live and breathe this music and want you to get immersed with them.The Tea Pad are seven years into a remarkable story that began with four friends studying at Newcastle University and now sees them playing venues and festivals across the UK and mainland Europe. Based in Newcastle Upon Tyne but with members hailing from Orkney to Warwickshire, the Tea Pad sound draws on myriad influences – from Bob Wills to Django Reinhardt, George Jones to Tom Waits – yet ultimately sounds like nobody else, that North Eastern Swing style that’s utterly their own and changing all the time.Across their four albums – 2012’s “Money Isn’t Everything”, 2014’s “Talk About The Weather”, 2016’s “Something Blue” and the brand new “Soul Of My City” – the band have constantly added new flavours to their sound: Heron in particular is a vinyl obsessive, always fired up about some new passion – calypso or boogaloo or whatever this week brings – and that eclecticism feeds into their songs, with the new album adding twangy 60s guitar tones and modernist R&B styles.The band tour the way bands should – widely and endlessly – winning friends and fans at each new show with notable performances at festivals like Glastonbury, Bestival, Wilderness and Cambridge Folk Festival. They’ve appeared twice on Radio 4’s Loose Ends, and had their music played by everyone from Marc Riley to Huey Morgan.November 2018 sees the band release their single “Life Is A Drag” on Germany’s Migraine Records ahead of their upcoming album “Soul Of My City”, which is released on Tea Pad Recordings on February 1st 2019.Joining Rob Heron (vocals and guitar) is Ben Fitzgerald (guitar), Tom Cronin (mandolin and harmonica), Colin Nicholson (accordion) and Ted Harbot (double bass) and Paul Archibald (drums). “Hank did it like this. So did Sinatra. So did Tom Waits. So did John Lee Hooker. Mix these influences with a healthy dose of youthful enthusiasm, a real passion and an ear for detail, sheer authenticity, and a good slug of both Scotch and Bourbon, and you might find that the results are very much to your taste. They are certainly to mine.” Mark Whyatt, Folk Radio“Newcastle’s finest swing-honkytonk-rockabilly band” – fRoots“That’s one hot band right there!” – Huey Morgan, BBC Radio 2“Rob Heron evokes the spirit of Bob Wills and Django Reinhardt with a quintet that shuffles and boogies with panache.

The dapper (and sometimes playfully unhinged) singer/guitarist is both down-to-earth and as intense as Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen, with a little wild Joe Cocker soul in there, too.” Ken Maiuri (Northampton Gazette)",THE BASEMENT BAR,Sun 13th October 8:00pm,£ 12.00,[]
105,Jesse Terry + Special Guest,"A true musical journeyman, New England-based singer/songwriter JESSE TERRY has made it his mission to share his love of music fully and completely, without regard for shading his emotions or tempering his convictions.  The ability to create a connection, to bare his soul and express his feelings through his songs has been the defining thread in a career that began in 2010 and has spawned five albums (The Runner, Empty Seat on a Plane, Stay Here With Me, and his latest pair, Stargazer and Natural). A career that has seen Terry play over a thousand shows around the world, including such notable festivals as Bonnaroo, 30A Songwriters Festival, Philadelphia Folk Festival and the Americana Music Association’s AmericanaFest.Natural, a very sparse and acoustic album compared to its predecessor Stargazer, finds Jesse relying on a more organic approach to his music, while adding an additional layer of emotional impact with the help of some of the female singers he admires most: Dar Williams, Cary Ann Hearst of Shovels & Rope, Liz Longley, Kim Richey, Annie Clements, Sarah Darling and Erin Rae. The relationship between the two singers, the male and female — the contrast in emotion, tone and texture — became the focus of the album, while still keeping true to the power of a song, stripped down to one guitar. ",,Sun 13th October 8:30pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydOal9N6jw4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydOal9N6jw4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydOal9N6jw4', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydOal9N6jw4']"

Jawbone have quickly become a band with a unique sound, focused on delivering strong songs.Jawbone are all highly respected musicians in the industry. They have played with Tom Jones, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Ten Years After, Van Morrison Robert Plant, Dave Gilmour, Seth Lakeman, Cliff Richard, Ginger Baker, Ronnie Wood, Shuggie Otis, Laura Marling, James Hunter, Phil Manzanera, Garth Hudson, Jimmy Carl Black – and that’s just scratching the surface!Named after a song taken from The Band’s self-titled 1969 second album, Jawbone tracked their debut album live as a four piece with minimal overdubs at London’s State of The Ark Studio using the famous EMI desk originally installed in the Pathé Marconi studios in Paris. The distinctive voices of Paddy Milner and Marcus Bonfanti compliment and contrast throughout the songs as they share lead vocal duties on the album. Rex Horan’s searing falsetto vocals create the three-part harmony that has become a hallmark of the Jawbone sound.Taking influences from Little Feat, The Band, The Rolling Stones and Crosby, Stills Nash & Young but also mixing it with the eclectic musical backgrounds that each member brings, allows Jawbone to create a very fresh take on rock’n’roll.“What a belting night at the O2 Academy 2 last night.

113,Baskery,"THIS EVENT IS TAKING PLACE AT OUR ALTERNATIVE HOME FOR THE NIGHT, THE OLD QUEENS HEAD: 44 Essex Rd, London N1 8LNBASKERY: The three sisters can’t recall when or why they started playing, the music’s always just been there. In their late teens, the sisters joined forces with their dad, who for decades was a one man band playing old blues and country tunes for a living.This foundation of classic “roots music and Americana” settled in their hearts, but also awoke the urge of breaking the rules of traditional music. Baskery is a band built on what three people can do together and it’s all about turning the music on its head, blending the straightforwardness of punk with the subtlety of singer/ songwriting.The first album, “Fall Among Thieves” (2008) was recorded in Stockholm, co-produced by Lasse Mårtén (Pink, ‘Peter, Bjorn and John’, Kelly Clarkson, Lykke Li, Primal Scream ). “New Friends” (2011) the follow up, the band referred to it as the “gypsy album” since it was mainly tracked on the road in various hotel rooms and band apartments, then mixed in Berlin by Blackpete (Depeche Mode, Joe Jackson, Peter Fox). As a contrast to the first two albums which took several months to make, the third one “Little Wild Life” (2013) was recorded during ten days in an old dance studio converted to a studio in former east Berlin, co-produced by Matt Wignall (Cold War Kids, J. Roddy Walston, Wargirl).All three albums received great acclaim by the press and are released in numerous countries. The releases in combination with relentless touring have given the band a reputation as one of the music scene’s most noticeable live acts.In early 2014 the band started working with Kobalt Music Publishing which lead to collaborations with high-profile songwriters such as Billy Steinberg (Madonna, The Bangles, (Cyndi Lauper), Joe Henry (John Denver) and Jimmy Harry (Madonna, Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears) and Lincoln Parish (Cage the Elephant).Since the very beginning of Baskery the sisters have guarded their independence but when approached by Dan McCarroll (President and A&R) at Warner Music , they felt intrigued to break their indie tradition and make their next record on a major label. In August 2014 they signed a world wide recording deal with Warner Bros Music (Los Angeles). Baskery is one of few Swedish acts to get signed directly to a US majorAbout Baskery www.baskeryband.comrecord company. The recordings the made under the term came out as a full length album ”Coyote & Sirens” in October 2018, produced and engineered by Andrew Dawson (Kanye West, Rolling Stones, f.u.n, The Revivalists).In 2015 the sisters were invited to join legendary artist Robbie Williams as opener and special guests on his arena-tour throughout Europe. Later the same year they also toured the US with Gary Clark Jr and Brandi Carlile2017 and 2018 were both equally busy with multiple international tours, including appearances at Bonnaroo, Newport Folk Festival, Arroyo Seco, UtopiaFest and Bottlerock alongside artists like Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alabama Shakes, Dr John, Mumford and Sons, The Meters, The Avett Brothers and more..",OLD QUEEN'S HEAD,Thu 17th October 8:00pm,£ 14.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Nz64WS_edk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7rL9vc3Jpk?feature=oembed']"

His eponymous debut was a predominantly solo affair, and garnered significant national press, notably in UNCUT and The Guardian. The second, Outside My Mind, added an Americana expanse to the folk foundations of his debut, cutting live to tape to create a warm, spacious sound. It was released to wide acclaim on Aveline Records in 2017 (Ani Difranco, Ruth Theodore), and played across BBC 6Music and BBC Radio Scotland. DREAM SWEETHEART builds further on this creative dynamic. With ten days in the studio, and working from simple acoustic demos, the ethos of the record was one of invention and spontaneity. The copper pan loops on Slower than the Sea, the train/rain soundtrack to Stay A Little Longer, the late night recording of cicadas that accompanies Miles Between – these are just a sample of the soundscapes that resulted from staying open and alive to the possibilities each song suggested, whilst keeping Ned’s voice front and centre.Ned has toured widely around the UK. He attained a much sought after support tour with celebrated US songwriter Anais Mitchell, and has also supported the likes of Joe Pug, Micah P. Hinson, The Delines, Sam Morrow, and The Stray Birds. He has toured the West Coast of the US, and recently embarked on a 10 date tour of Germany, as well as gigs in France, Spain and Italy.DREAM SWEETHEART will be released on October 21st on Aveline Records, with a UK tour in November.",THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB,Mon 21st October 8:00pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jaz32f5cx6w']"

122,Kirsty McGee & Ben Bedford,"A couple of years ago, at 3 in the morning, two songwriters collided in a seventh floor corridor at the Crown Westin Hotel, Kansas City Missouri. One was noticeable for his large beard and the other was a woman carrying a saw. This year, for the first time and for a limited run of shows, these two artists Kirsty McGee (UK) and Ben Bedford (US) will be touring and collaborating together.Ben Bedford
For 12 years, since the release of his first album, Bedford has toured his vivid, stark tales across America, Europe and beyond. A true son of the heartland, Bedford dips into the deep inkwell of classic American literature and writes with the ‘old soul’ quality of his literary idols, such as John Steinbeck and Toni Morrison. Living with his cat Darwin in an old farmhouse on the edge of a prarie in Illinois, Ben’s soft-voiced poetry and captivating guitar work has led to him being compared to such luminaries as Townes Van Zandt, Bob Dylan and John Prine.   Last year, his highly acclaimed 5th album The Hermit’s Spyglass was released and he was named one of the six Kerrville New Folk winners at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas.2018 Kerrville New Folk Winner
“Certainly one of the best young singer songwriters working today.”  Rob Adams, The Herald, ScotlandKirsty McGee
Sharing Bedford’s literary leanings and with a voice that has been described as having the texture of ‘smoke and velvet’ Kirsty McGee has created a unique songbook, drawing on old vinyl blues, gospel, ’30s jazz, Brechtian ballads and Brill Building sensibilities…. An innate curiousity, a DIY ethic and an abiding love of the Great American Songbook, have taken her from Odessa to Nashville, and from the Mojave Desert to arctic Norway. In 2013 her song Sandman was featured on UK filmmaker Danny Boyle’s movie Trance & tweeted about by Emma Watson. In seventeen years on the road, she has toured in 11 countries, peddling her skewed but romantic ‘hobopop’ (music without a genre) to anyone who’ll listen. McGee’s 8th album, part inspired by the Cole Porter songbook, will come out in October 2019.“Haunting, stimulating but always genre-defying…a level of lyrical insight and timeless imagery that belies its 21st century creation…A film-noir album of blues, jazz, folk and retro shuffles. Classy.” **** R2  ",GREEN NOTE,Tue 22nd October 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsESnb1S6Q?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-RkjYbkbS8?feature=oembed', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyhIVPKOpgs?feature=oembed']"

Tim Penn is of course no stranger to Green Note, having played The Basement Bar regularly ever since it opened in 2014, along with Second Line guitarist, Chris Proctor. Going back to the 1970s, he played with the legendary Dorris Henderson’s Eclection and also in the Kevin Coyne band alongside Andy Summers (The Police) and Gordon Smith (Described by John Peel as ” The foremost white Blues guitarist in the world “).  These days, as well as leading The Second Line, he can also be found playing with The Cadillac Kings (“The U.K.’s finest purveyors of blues & swing” Blues in Britain Magazine).
“These guys are amazing!! Their popularity and presence grow with each gig they do for us. Not surprising with the exceptional level of talent, commitment and all round positive energy they bring to every performance”  The Ram Jam Club at The Grey Horse, Kingston“Right from the outset, the album sounds like it was recorded at a different time, sometime in the past when music was music.

133,Willy Porter,"WILLY PORTER: Willy Porter has been turning first time listeners into die hard fans for more than two decades. Willy blurs the line between indie-folk and rock with his searing signature finger-picking guitar sound, absorbing lyrics, and playful, high-energy live performance style. He has shared world stages with music icons Jeff Beck, Tori Amos, and Paul Simon, carving out a successful solo career as an artist who makes music that resonates long after the last guitar chord fades.From the release of his breakthrough album, 1994’s Dog Eared Dream, to the launch of his own record label, Weasel Records, in 2005, Willy is an artist dedicated to delivering high-test, original musical experiences. His 2015 album, Human Kindness, featured the songs “Train” and “Chippewa Boots,” performed live on NPR’s A Prairie Home Companion by Willy and his singing/songwriting partner, Carmen Nickerson. The pair teamed up again in 2016 to make Bonfire to Ash, a record of co-writes produced by Grammy award-winner Ben Wisch (Marc Cohn, Jonathan Brooke).Equally accomplished as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter, his songs weave a universal perspective about the questions, struggles, and triumphs of human existence. His live shows are guitar-driven events–equal parts grit, soul, and muscle–that are electrifying, dynamic, and wholly original in the way that Willy’s voice blends and fuses with his galvanising fret work.Whether in the studio or on stage, Willy Porter gifts listeners with an unforgettable ride, embodying the very best of what live music has to offer.“If you need another flat-top guitar hero, look no further than Willy Porter, a blindingly fleet and maddeningly nimble player. If you’re trying to get the hang of fingerstyle picking, you’ll either curse the dude or forsake all and follow him.” Riverfront Times

134,Senora May,"SENORA MAY: Senora May’s music and voice undulates like the foothills, hollers, and benches of the Appalachian Mountains she calls home. A frugal lifestyle in rural Kentucky has contributed to her experience in and commitment to self-reliance, resiliency, hard work and independence. Senora is known for merging the realism of these intrinsic values with a soft, romantic approach at storytelling. Her songs are an optimistic yet gritty portfolio of her habitat, exhibiting the triumphs and tolls of hard loving in a hard culture. As listeners join the rapidly growing fanbase of Senora May, they are transported to a homestead in a simpler time of the mountain culture, while clinging to gender equality and other invaluable lessons taught by present day constraints of society.  Her songs, like the artist herself, are adamant on maintaining the delicate balance of these forces for an honest translation of her experiences as a woman born unto the Appalachian Culture, a woman in love with nature’s cyclical offerings of life and death and the gettin’ by in between.Senora’s childhood,  growing up the second youngest of 6 children, taught her to value the natural world and human connections. She often romped around catching snakes, making mudpies, picking wildflowers, trying to impress her brothers with bluegill or bass she caught and seeking approval of her father who worked religiously. Just over the hill, her grandfather provided an unnerving set of standards as an avid outdoorsman that would imprint her ideal of men forever; He was tough, seemingly devoid of emotional inconsistencies women are often associated with. On the contrary, her mother, a stained glass artist herself, was a constant and romantic support system for the arts, encouraging Senora to explore multi-media expression, including but not limited to violin, oil painting, stained glass, pencil drawing, charcoal, watercolor, flute, poetry, mosaics, woodworking, ceramics, creative writing, natural dyes, crocheting, and of course, guitar, singing and songwriting.Many of Senora’s songs were inspired by her encounters with solitude. Some were born from her traipsin’ around Europe in college when she lied to her parents about the duration of her study abroad. She’d hitchhiked from Ostia, Italy to Dublin, Ireland, across countries, through major cities and along dirt, back roads finding refuge among the kindhearted folks of rural Slovenia, Germany and England. Some songs were conceived while she lived in a yurt in the Redlick Valley, where a wood stove and her dog, Lucy were among her only constant companions.Her debut album, Lainhart, exhibits her songwriting techniques of storytelling through living and loving with the hope that these songs are the start of a long conversation between her encounters and her fans. This premier album is, simply put, a fine introduction of her potential as a vital voice in the history of Kentucky and Appalachian culture.Senora May lives in Estill County, Kentucky, home of Kickin’ It On The Creek, The Ravenna Railroad Festival, Pickin’ in the Park, Steam Engine Session Room, La Cabana, numerous Carhartt facilities, and one radioactive landfill.",GREEN NOTE,Mon 28th October 8:30pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9-i3RiWwcg', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQ3V0AMd0Gw']"

138,Ana Egge,"When ANA EGGE got bit by the music bug as a teenager, she took matters into her own hands, building her own guitar, and moving to Austin, TX to observe, absorb and take musical risks. The striking depth and unusual maturity of her singing, playing, and songwriting got her noticed, and she recorded her first album, River Under the Road (1997) with the legendary western swing band, Asleep At The Wheel. The Austin Music Awards named her “Best Singer/Songwriter” and “Best Folk Artist.” Over the ensuing years and 8 subsequent CDs, Ana has made good on that promising debut. She has worked with producers Martin Terefe, Jason Mercer, Joel Plaskett, Steve Earle, and Stewart Lerman, and recorded full albums with The Stray Birds and The Sentimentals. Now, in 2018, she has released White Tiger, her tenth album, a new batch of Egge originals of such singularly articulate and affecting honesty and sensitivity, as to once again deserve USA Today’s accolade, “[Ana] can write and sing rings around” her contemporaries.Ana Egge grew up with parents who “dropped out,” choosing to raise four girls in a lovingly cobbled together combination of a small farmhouse on the North Dakota plains, a bus on the California Coast, and a hot springs commune in rural New Mexico, scraping together dimes and hand-me-downs. Ana learned that her life was truly hers to create. “We were always the outsiders,” she says. “I was taught how to shoot a gun and how to enjoy alfalfa sprouts and tofu. I ran around barefoot and learned to ride a motorcycle when I was 5. I grew up with all the time and space in the world.” Given her unconventional upraising, it’s not surprising that Ana has since been plotting her own journey, confident, fearless, and uncompromising.
She’s been around the horn of life’s experiences, having forsaken the Great Plains for Sunset Park in Brooklyn, and gotten married and become a mother, but she’s never lost touch with the free-spirited childhood and the Western landscape that formed her.That questing spirit is everywhere evident on White Tiger. “Western Movie” finds a parallel for her freewheeling adolescence in the Tucson of Martin Scorcese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, while “Last Ride” fondly recalls a romance on the road (I borrowed my uncle’s motorbike / And I headed north on Interstate 5 / You were waiting and jumped on behind / I couldn’t wait to make you hold on tight). Ana’s later, big city escapades are chronicled in “Girls, Girls, Girls,” an evocation of a young lesbian first making the scene (New York City was the place to to be / Waiting on my man, waiting on sweet Jane), while “Dance Around The Room” finds Ana as a more domesticated young(ish) mother serenading her 4-year old daughter (Reaching for the stars with you / And for the sun and moon / It opens up, opens up our hearts). An open heart can be everything to Ana, and it beats in the love songs “Be With You” (The church in the mountains / The cave where we slept / The city underground / The true love we kept), “You Among The Flowers”
(You among the others, I picked you in full bloom / Thought you were another, first time I met / You remind me of a woman I once knew / You remind me of all the ways I wanted you), and even in the sweet resignation of the album closer, “Let The Light In”
(Some kind of spell’s been broken down / Now I’m not afraid to be around you / Open the window and let the light in / Starting today we can finally be friends).That open-hearted spirit of adventure is also evident in the communal music-making of White Tiger, most notably in Ana’s collaboration with producer Alec Spiegelman (Cuddle Magic), whose contributions on reeds, keyboards, and vocals, together with his wind, string, and vocal arrangements, elegantly inform the whole. Other featured musicians include singer Anais Mitchell, guitarist Buck Meek (Big Thief), drummer Robin MacMillan (Aoife O’Donovan), bassist Jacob Silver (Amy Helm), and violist Adam Moss (The Brother Brothers). Particularly touching is Ana’s live trio version of John Hartford’s “In Tall Buildings” with singer/guitarist Billy Strings and violinist Alex Hargreaves. Ana wrote the song “White Tiger” as encouragement for a dear friend going through hell, and in need of her spirit guide (Keep your eyes on the tiger / Feed him, let him be your guide / Teach him freedom, that he might lead you / Through to the other side). Ana, herself, fiercely honest and compassionate, is not unlike that animal, near-miraculous, rare but real, and she, too, can take us through, enlighten our lives. She still plays that guitar she made herself all those years ago, and is still possessed by a self-determined sense of who she is and what she wants to do. As Lucinda Williams once told some friends, “Listen to her lyrics. Ana is the folk Nina Simone.” According to Shawn Colvin, “Ana has the rare gift of being so eloquent and simple that she takes your breath away. I just love her.” ",GREEN NOTE,Wed 30th October 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICr2jYGjPOk']"
139,Michelle Malone + Sarah Peacock,"“Malone emerges, not as an ingenue, but as the definition of the Atlanta rock sound–Southern, blues-touched, guitar-driven, but still about the song.” – No DepressionCompared to most musical artists in the Americana genre, MICHELLE MALONE seems like a pair of distressed blue jeans amidst a sea of pantsuits. Unlike the surplus of self-professed rootsy rebels, one listen to this woman from Dixie and you know you’re hearing the real thing. Credit Michelle Malone with doing things her own way for the better part of the past three decades, and defying expectations in the process.She’s had her share of success, courtesy of some 15 studio albums, her own independent SBS Records label, numerous top flight film and TV soundtracks, kudos from the critics and collaborations with a remarkable roster of amazing artists, among them, the late Gregg Allman, ZZ Top, Ellen DeGeneres and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Chuck Leavell, the master keyboardist who has backed both the the Rolling Stones and the Allman Brothers, cited her as “One of the best female vocalists I’ve ever heard.” It’s little wonder that Guitar World once hailed Malone as “Equal parts guitar slinger and sweet songstress, with masterful lyrical introspection –sublime to raucous.”Still Malone isn’t content to simply acknowledge her accomplishments.A singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer whose music is informed by blues, roadhouse rock & roll and Georgia soul, Malone’s stunning and stirring new album Slings and Arrows (Due 3/2/18 on her SBS Records) pushes the parameters even further. It’s upbeat, defiant, and jubilant, flush with the raw energy and emotion that’s always been a part of her signature sound all while nudging her deeper into some personal new territory she hasn’t explored before. Malone deals with issues that have been burned into her psyche and affected her deeply. These songs speak to desire and disappointment, optimism and awareness, all with a driving and fiery conviction. “It wasn’t planned that way”, she insists, “but inevitably, that’s how the album evolved”.  1.2 million miles, 2,800 shows, and fourteen years of flying solo is quite a road trip. SARAH PEACOCK bridges gaps between Country, Blues, Americana, and Rock-N-Roll. Her music is raw, truth telling, and fiercely unique. Held hostage by her record label at 21, the troubadour life came with a rude awakening for the young Georgia native. Peacock made her home in a ‘92 Volvo with her dog and a guitar, and for nearly seven years earned a living in the corner shadows of American dive bars. The tables turned in 2011 when an anonymous fan helped Peacock buy out of her recording contract. Since then, she has released six additional albums and won multiple awards for her song writing. “Hurricane” won Best Song in the American Song-writing Awards, and “Beautiful” was a winner with International Unsigned Only. “The Cool Kids” and “Are We There Yet” have nominated her for Best Female Artist and Best Song in a number of song-writing competitions. Peacock was also named Listening Room Network’s Artist of the Year.In 2013, Peacock released her self-produced album, Albuquerque Sky, recorded in hotel rooms across the country while maintaining her rigorous 250 show tour schedule. Albuquerque Sky was followed by a season of goodbyes, tremendous growth, and challenges, and became the catalyst for her next album, Dream On(2016). “This record helped me get un-stuck. I had a collection of live recordings which became Dream On. After such a creative dry spell, I knew I needed to hit the road and stay out a while –reconnect with my fans,” says a determined Peacock. “I found thisold silver eagle tour bus in Austin, TX. I was so enchanted with it, and the renovation process really reigniting my troubadour flame. So I bought my very first bus. Oh, what a feeling!” But less than 4 months later, she would watch it burn to the ground at a California truck stop.One of Peacock’s fans voluntarily initiated a fundraiser, which is what kept her on the road. Another fan, so touched by her story, donated his motor home so that her tour could go on. That special connection between Sarah Peacock and her fans is what gives her the strength to continue overcoming. “You have to be unstoppable, even when you don’t believe you are.” That’s the modus operandi for the now half Tennessean, half Texan road warrior.Sarah Peacock is active in the anti-bullying community, and her song, “The Cool Kids” has become a powerful anti-bullying anthem. Its message has taken on a life of its own. As she travels the country, Peacock shares her story in schools, empowering young people to embody her message of kindness and love.",GREEN NOTE,Thu 31st October 8:30pm,£ 12.50,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPoTzfgZl8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC1krLFvAeM']"
140,Poor Nameless Boy,"POOR NAMELESS BOY: Disarming in a moment, his soft, melodic delivery is born from a keen perception of the human condition. This understated authenticity is why you’ll find Poor Nameless Boy on the fringes of something much deeper than modern indie-folk. In his quest to retain a certain humbled anonymity, Regina-based Joel Henderson has, in fact, made himself more noticeable than ever.Though similar to his contemporaries with his wispy, shiver-worthy vocal tones reminiscent of Donovan Woods and Gregory Alan Isakov; Henderson’s stark vulnerability sets him apart, coupled with a deep lyrical poignancy. Since the release of Activity Book (2013), and the proceeding, stunningly beautiful and acclaimed Bravery (2016); Henderson has seen some notable milestones, including a recent publishing deal and several successful tours and showcases in Canada and Europe.WAKE UP CALL THE EP: Now releasing his new EP, Poor Nameless Boy has upped the ante yet again. Using a measured sparsity, Henderson and producer Brad Prosko have found a perfect dynamic to tell the deeply affecting stories brought to life on “Wake Up Call”. And though the songs themselves play out in the first person, their empathic ability to engage and insight is unparalleled. This cunning, relatable disposition puts Henderson in some rare company.Henderson’s striking grasp of life’s complexities is mirrored by a pure modesty, allowing listeners to immerse themselves into the stories, songs and experiences of Poor Nameless Boy without pretence. With no desire to be seen as a brand or commodity, his humanistic proposition is entirely irresistible, and as a songwriter, effortlessly engaging.",THE BASEMENT BAR,Fri 1st November 8:00pm,£ 10.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JPMlpUpB1Q', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JPMlpUpB1Q', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JPMlpUpB1Q', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JPMlpUpB1Q', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JPMlpUpB1Q']"

After a standing ovation at the Montreaux festival she went on to guest on Acid Jazz, London Records and Music for Nations record labels.Looking back to her upbringing, Kat hales from a family steeped in the tradition of Gospel hymns and Blues folklore; from Sharecropping in Oklahoma to Civil Rights riots in Los Angeles, her roots go all the way back to the cotton fields of rural Tennessee.Whilst taking some time off in Spain, Kathleen finally rediscovered a genre of music that was closer to her heart than she could have ever imagined.

“Purposely timeless yet anachronistic, a sort of aural steampunk”
Santa Fe New MexicanImagine if Simon and Garfunkel were lost at sea, salt on their skin, wind in their beards, and whiskey in their bottles. With only the endless sky above, the wine-dark waters below, and one brush with death after another, what songs would they sing whilst stomping on the boards of their boat like melodious madmen?Welcome to the mythic world of SON OF TOWN HALL, the unusual union of Ben Parker of London, England, and David Berkeley of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Parker, a highly sought-after London-based songwriter/producer/multi-instrumentalist, and Berkeley, a celebrated singer/songwriter/guitarist/author create a world that transcends time and space, complete with shabby Victorian-era outfits, meditations about the sea, and songs that beg you to sing along. It will leave you transformed, with your heart full of laughter and tears, drunk on adventure and the tragic beauty of the human condition.Despite the incongruous pairing, Parker and Berkeley sing together with an angelic blend, a harmony so sublime you will think it the work of witchcraft. It’s why they are in such high demand, selling out rooms around the world, performing at the Philadelphia Folk Festival, The Lyons Folks Festival, The Dusseldorf Festival, The Dranouter Festival, The Medicine Hat Festival and many more.The critically acclaimed duo has just completed its debut full-length album, an astonishing collection of songs featuring Sara Watkins on fiddle, members of Beck and De La Soul’s horn section, a string section from Atlanta, GA, and a German choir. Releasing this November, the album was mixed by Grammy-nominated Darren Heelis (Avett Brothers, Sam Smith, Rag n Bone Man). The packaging alone warrants notice, featuring an original India-ink portrait of the pair by D.C. Lamothe and a reprint of a wonderful article written at the turn of the century about the two, describing their checkered pasts and their rise to musical glory.Son of Town Hall’s performances aren’t quite like any other. The show is three-parts concert, one-part theater. The songs stand alone, profoundly poetic turn of phrases sung with voices so perfectly matched it is nearly impossible to tell them apart, and accompanied by intricately finger picked parts played on old Gibson. But the presentation sets them apart from every other guitar-slinging songwriting team out there. Parker and Berkeley are disarmingly charismatic, and despite the deadpan delivery, their between song repartee is absolutely hilarious. The affection they feel for each other is contagious, and audiences leave in love with both of them and perhaps more in love with life in general.",THE WATER RATS,Tue 12th November 8:00pm,£ 14.00,[]
157,Jack Rutter – Album Launch,"Gold of Scar & Shale, the second solo album from traditional folk singer and multi-instrumentalist JACK RUTTER will be available CD/DL from October 4th 2019.Produced by Joe Rusby and recorded as live, the new album continues the stripped back approach of its critically acclaimed predecessor, Jack’s debut solo outing Hills. The songs on Gold of Scar & Shale are unearthed gems from the folk canon – almost all of them rare and many previously unrecorded – gathered from old song books and source singers as Jack uncovered material for this major new release of traditional song.Jack’s soaring vocal takes centre stage on the album, delivering each traditional tale in a fresh and current way; his masterful playing and arrangements providing the perfect accompaniment. Jack contributes guitar, bouzouki, duet concertina and harmonium to the album with featured guest musicians Sam Sweeney on fiddle, Alice Robinson on Northumbrian pipes and Sam Fisher on flugelhorn.There is a strong sense of place on the new record too; over half of the songs have a connection to Jack’s native Yorkshire. The album title itself Gold of Scar & Shale comes from a line in one such track ‘The Hills of Longdendale’, with words written by ‘The Moorland Poet’ Ammon Wrigley (1861-1946). Jack says “to me Ammon Wrigley is describing the rough and bleak parts of the moorland with this line, the scar and the shale that is always nevertheless gold to him. I love this line and realised that for me it’s also a great metaphor for traditional songs; rough, stark and honest things that contain such riches. I found then that I’d stumbled upon the perfect title for this album, or at least one that I really loved anyhow.”Jack grew up in the Holme Valley area of West Yorkshire, a place steeped in a wealth of traditional song, and following a BSc degree in Countryside Management at Newcastle University has forged a highly successful career playing music across the UK and Europe. In addition to his acclaimed solo work, Jack has become a highly sought after collaborator for a host of the biggest names in folk music such as Seth Lakeman, Sam Sweeney and Jackie Oates as well as performing in the celebrated instrumental trio Moore Moss Rutter.The release of his forthcoming album however is set to confirm his place as a solo artist, singer and performer of traditional songs first and foremost. By shining a light on these original sources and singers, with Gold of Scar & Shale Jack has crafted a collection very much his own.",GREEN NOTE,Tue 12th November 8:30pm,£ 12.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECE_RJIBzGw']"
158,Kim Richey,"KIM RICHEY: “[Kim Richey] would rule the charts in a land where Marshall Crenshaw was king, Aimee Mann queen, and the The Beatles never put out another record after Revolver.” Steve Horowitz, popmatters.com
“Richey entices you with sad and unembellished music that reveals an original spirit ‐ and then she ensnares you for keeps by making you consider all the noiseless sensations that no songs can ever contain.” Timothy White, Billboard MagazineEdgeland, her latest release, moves roots singer/subtle excavator of the human condition Kim Richey through the topography of the life lived by a woman committed to following her music. Flinching over hurting another, knowing the ways of the road, seeking higher ground and accepting the fact everyone’s truth isn’t a white picket fence, she continues defying labels as she defines the thinking person’s life.“Right now, my stuff is all in storage,” she says of her state of constant motion. “I’ve lived in a lot of different places – different countries even. It’s a little overwhelming, keeping track of stuff, but it’s been an amazing trip because music has taken me places I never dreamed.“I’m the same way with writing. Even when I’ve finished a record, or am in the middle of recording, I’m writing. Writing songs is what I do; it’s how I connect with the world.”That sense of motion infuses Edgeland with immediacy. From the Buck Owens/Don Rich opening notes of “Red Line,” the dusky blond sweeps listeners up in her whirl. If “Red Line” is a missed train and a moment of immersion in the station, “The Get Together” shimmers with a Laurel Canyon lushness and ease in the awkward (that evokes J.D. Souther’s post-romantic midtempos) and “Can’t Seem To Let You Go” owns the ‘60s Merseybeat pop luxury of the Seekers or Dusty Springfield in Memphis. Demonstrating a facility for slipping in and out of oeuvres and emotions, this – in many ways — culminates her passage through music.Kim Richey is a traveller, after all. Musically, physically, emotionally. Not merely restless or rootless, it’s who she is. Willing to follow where the music leads, she’s landed in Los Angeles, Nashville, London, working with a who’s who of producers – Richard Bennett, Hugh Padgham, Bill Bottrell, Angelo, Giles Martin. She’s attracted a coterie of top-shelf genre-definers — Jason Isbell, Trisha Yearwood, Chuck Prophet, My Morning Jacket’s Carl Broemel, Wilco’s Pat Sansone – for her critically-lauded projects. She has also sung on records for Ryan Adams, Shawn Colvin, Isbell, and Rodney Crowell.Part of what draws them to the dusky honey of her crystalline alto is the way she writes: to and from the soul, never flinching from the conflicts and crushing moments, yet always finding dignity and resilience. Her arc of the human heart is true. True enough that over the years, Richey’s been both Grammy nominated. Nominated for Yearwood’s truculently groove-country “Baby, I Lied,” she also co-wrote Radney Foster’s #1 “Nobody Wins.”“Harlan Howard said – and maybe I’ve taken it too much to heart, ‘It’s always more believable if you sing it in the first person.’ And when I sit down to write, if it’s something I’m going to sing, I want it to be what I want it to be. I don’t really settle, which may make me a little hard to write with. But I have to be able to stand up and sing it night after night, and I can’t if I don’t really believe it.”Those standards made Glimmer one of TIME’s Top Records of 1999 and Rise named People’s Best Alt-Country Record of 2002. Even when singing from the point of view of a guy working on a barge going up and down the Ohio River in “Dear John,” her aim is true. As she says of the man refusing to read the letter that ends his romance, “because if I don’t read your letter, then it’s not over. Sometimes these songs are specific and personal, but it’s also true in ways that reflect so many other people’s experience, too.”Sometimes Richey channels profound truths. Sometimes she embraces breezy freedom. “Leavin’ Song,” a rambler’s shuffle, is more about tasting the world than exiting a bad situation. As its chorus offers, “This ain’t no leaving song, you ain’t done nothing wrong” over an electric banjo and Resonator guitar, Richey finds the sweet spot in exulting for just being alive.Once again, Richey has drawn a multitude of collaborators who rival her own singular voice. Veteran journeymen artist/writers Chuck Prophet, Maendo Sanz, Mike Henderson (Steeldrivers), Bill Deasy (the Gathering Field), Pat McLaughlin (John Prine) and Al Anderson (NRBQ), plus Aussies Jenny Queen and Harry Hokey co-sign on these musical polaroids from the going, the leaving, and the pausing.“I’ll be doing an interview, and people will say, ‘You co-write a lot…’,” she marvels, “like it’s a bad thing. But it’s inspiring to me, and takes me in other directions, to other places. The people I write with are funny, and smart, and a blast to hang out with, but they’re also really good writers in their own right. Nobody’s pandering or chasing ‘a hit,’ we’re all just trying to get to the best possible song.”Whether growing up, owning and relinquishing high times in the sleek “Chase Wild Horses,” echoed in the ether-lite, percussive folk “High Time,” then jettisoned on the smoky acceptance of her own flawed inability to be in a romance on the Western-tinged on “I Tried,” the woman from Ohio makes our natural selves both exotic and homey.Richey enlisted producer Brad Jones, known for Over the Rhine, Josh Rouse, Butterfly Boucher, Hayes Carll and Marshall Crenshaw, in crafting an adult album that evokes and provokes musically. “I wasn’t sure at first if we’d be a good combo because he has such strong opinions, and I do, too. But it was (laughter) the easiest record I’ve ever made. He has really different ideas, and it’s nice to have somebody push you in a direction you might not have gone – and have them respect your opinion, too. I really loved working with Brad.””With three different tracking bands, Edgeland is a who’s who of Nashville’s roots players: beyond co-writers, steel player Dan Dugmore, drummer Jerry Roe, multi-instrumentalist Sansone, guitarist/various stringed thing players Doug Lancio and Dan Cohen, string arranger Chris Carmichael and Robin Hitchcock all contribute to the bewitchery.“So many of these guys produce and make records on their own,” she marvels. “I’m open to collaboration, too. These songs wouldn’t sound the way they do without these players.”The noir-slink of “Pin A Rose,” a cautionary told-you-so tale of domestic abuse’s repeat cycles, the neo-madrigal “Not for Money or Love,” inspired by the father Richey lost at 2, and the Mellotron-tinged austerity of “Black Trees,” finished after a few years gestation during a residency at the Banff Centre for the Arts Colony and expanded to consider a refugee’s fortunes, all seek and explore. Here melody reinforces words, feelings, even interpersonal dynamics. Simplicity – as executed – breaks complicated things into evocative clouds that seep into the listeners unconscious.“It’s a lot easier to say something in a song than in a conversation,” allows the easy-going grown-up. “And it’s not all about me, but the people in the songs. Even the stuff you leave out says something, so you’re creating on so many layers. And sometimes I don’t know where it comes from, just some other place.”Listening to “Whistle On Occasion,” the Everly-esque closer duet with Prophet, Richey owns one’s place in the world. Here, there, going or gone, that’s all anyone can ask.SUPPORT FROM AUBURN: Auburn has been captivating audiences around the world with their unique blend of Americana, blues and roots music. Fronted by female vocalist Liz Lenten, who’s voice has been described as “so sweet it’ll make your hair curl” and “husky, with an emotional frailty,” who “isn’t afraid to show her full range of vocal tones or emotions.”
With varied influences from Bonnie Raitt, Billie Holiday, Amy Winehouse to Kate Bush, Liz’s songs grab you melodically and tell stories of life’s ups and downs. She has toured extensively including supporting artists Sophie Ellis Bextor, Jefferson Starship, Live Dead 69, Martin Carthy & Dave Swarbrick and many more. Liz, a very UN-typical English rose, (she describes herself as “a mongrel – descending from several places in Eastern Europe”) now lives in the Wolds of Lincolnshire, where she spends her time writing, performing and running music groups for young people living in rural isolation and other
challenging circumstances, as well as managing other artists including Eliza Carthy and Shane MacGowan. She was nominated for an “English Heritage Inspiration Award in 2012,” for her work bringing singing and music to the community.
The new album was mainly written in the last few months of 2018, in a flurry of outpouring! As always with Liz Lenten’s prolific song writing themes cover the usual range of reflections of emotions and situations – focusing this album on Trust, in all sorts of relationships and situations. Says Liz, “Its been a couple of crazy years for me, with huge personal life changes – which lead to me losing my voice completely at one point, all of which left me struggling to trust my own judgement and learning to live on faith and hope – which is essentially all we have to go on when things get out of control.”
As with Auburn’s previous releases, the band’s new album was recorded once again in Nashville. Says Liz, “Nashville is one of the most wonderful cities on earth to me – buzzing with music and creativity. My fantastic multi-award-winning producer, Thomm Jutz, (Nanci Griffith, Mary Gauthier, Bill Anderson, Otis Gibbs, Mac Wiseman,), totally brings my ideas to life, is there, so I would go wherever he was! And the musicians are amazing – all so incredibly talented and sensitive – and just lovely people

166,Josienne Clarke,"** PLEASE NOTE: This show will take place at our alternative home for the evening: BUSH HALL, 310 Uxbridge Road, London, W12 7LJ. Doors open 7.30pm. Music starts 8pm. ** When JOSIENNE CLARKE signed to the illustrious independent music champions Rough Trade Records, its founder Geoff Travis told The Guardian that she writes,“songs that rearrange your internal emotional landscape… reinventing the popular song structure.”With a rare gift for poetic melancholy, Josienne’s songs have also been described as “extraordinary” (Mojo), “gently exquisite” (The Observer) and “full of depth” (The Telegraph). While the world music bible Songlines said, “Clarke’s dark,complex imagery in the lyrics pushes the songs into rich metaphorical territory, one of the heart and of self-enquiry.” American Songwriter magazine named Josienne one of the best songwriters of 2016.Having been awed by a live performance at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, 6 Music DJ Cerys Matthews arranged for Josienne to act and sing in The National Theatre’s revival of Timberlake Wertenbaker’s Our Country’s Good. In addition to performing on the Olivier stage each night – in a role specially created for her – Josienne contributed two of her own songs to the play. In their review of the acclaimed production, The Financial Times said, “Josienne Clarke sings like a haunted angel.”It marked the start of a continued relationship with the National Theatre, which has included composing songs for a new adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson’s The Snow Queen, with acclaimed young playwright Zoe Cooper.With an elegant, nuanced and emotionally affecting singing style (Cerys Matthews described her as having a voice that can “trickle back over centuries”) Josienne has frequently been compared to the great Sandy Denny, but present too are elements of Nina Simone and Gillian Welch; all three are important influences on her work.Expanding beyond the folk music for which she was first known, Josienne has partnered with rising star jazz pianist Kit Downes to release the Such A Sky EP. And her friendship with London-based Scottish singer songwriter Samantha Whates has bloomed into new group Pica Pica, whose debut album will be released by Rough Trade. fRoots magazine has already described the band’s sound as “originally exciting”.In the last two years, Josienne has supported the great Richard Thompson on a dream-come-true tour of the UK and opened for the legendary Robert Plant across Europe. The summer of 2018 saw her perform with guitarist Ben Walker at some of the UK’s best-loved festivals, including Latitude, Larmer Tree and End Of The Road. She even found herself in demand as a writer and broadcaster, contributing to Standard Issue magazine and appearing on BBC Radio 3’s The Verb to discuss her pet subject melancholy, alongside poet Simon Armitage.With several new records and theatrical productions to look forward to in 2019, Josienne Clarke remains one of the most impressive, accomplished and downright heart-breaking singers, lyricists and composers we’ve got. ",BUSH HALL,Tue 19th November 8:00pm,£ 12.50,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAc3a7ms-a8']"

Their songs tell the tales of their times – relationships, society, philosophy and politics, all told with the naive wisdom of late night bar talk ringing clear in every crevice. There’s anger and sadness, optimism, gladness – protest against something or other and after 18 months trawling the country for venues and listening ears, they now bring to the table a selection of songs from this first period of touring life.Tom is a jack of all trades, a failed jazz pianist taken to the guitar and Evie is a classical singer who never practiced her scales and decided she preferred singing folk songs instead. They draw on these failures to bring you a rather lovely melting pot of sounds and stories from every part of the western music map. You’ll hear exciting guitar solos, extravagant vocal extrapolations and every dynamic marking in the book, from near silent, dark folk ballads to rousing, roof-raising choruses, belted through soprano lungs.Evie and Tom are vibrant live performers and you should expect exciting, improvised interplay between vocal and guitar and many a story from these young troubadours.“Reminiscent of early Joni Mitchell”  RnR “A melting pot of sounds that have been expertly forged through live performance”  Rock Society Magazine “After a concert with Me, Thee & E the listener will feel like they have made such a secret discovery.

186,The Small Glories,"THE SMALL GLORIES: Roots duo The Small Glories are Cara Luft & JD Edwards, a musical tour-de-force partnership planted on the Canadian Prairies. With a stage banter striking a unique balance between slapstick and sermon, these veteran singer-songwriters have a way of making time disappear, rooms shrink, and audiences feel as though they are right there on the stage with the band.  On record, Luft and Edwards take the musical synergy honed from hundreds of shows together, and expand it into a new soundscape amplified by pounding drums and other textural embellishments which only reinforce the magic of their innate chemistry — a chemistry labeled the “Lennon-McCartney syndrome,” by Americana UK, writing, “Some things just work together… to witness a performance by The Small Glories is a rare opportunity to experience that indefinable quality that creates perfection.”  Luft and Edwards duplicate and reinforce each others’ many strengths and yet allow their distinct personalities to shine through, resulting in a live show that is as heartwarming as it is hilarious, as finger-picking proficient as it is relatable, and as Canadian as, well… it’s very Canadian. But that hasn’t stopped ‘em from winning over audiences from Nashville to the Australian Outback. Their highly anticipated sophomore album “Assiniboine & The Red” was released on June 28, 2019 on Compass/ Red House records.AMERICAN SONGWRITER
“ … when two voices meant to merge find each other, their power somehow multiplies… The Small Glories generate so much energy together they could almost form a hurricane… though blizzard might be a more apt metaphor for this Canadian duo.”NO DEPRESSION
“Perhaps The Small Glories need to rename themselves, for the full-hearted lyrics, the swelling harmonies, and the gorgeous fabric of the songs on this album are certainly large and wash over us with a powerful beauty that pulls at our hearts.”NPR MUSIC
“The Small Glories’ perform winsome, bluegrass-inflected folk-pop music that’s only deepened by their loose and lighthearted onstage chemistry. The pair’s concerts often double as comedy shows, wherein byzantine song intros somehow magnify the escapism of the buoyant songwriting. But the music itself is no joke: Luft is a Wailin’ Jennys alumna whose work on the clawhammer banjo is to die for, while Edwards’ guitar and vocal harmonies deepen and enrich the duo’s sound.”PASTE MAGAZINE
“[One of the] 10 Folk Artists You Need to Know in 2019.”POPMATTERS
“With a sense of place the overarching connection for the material, the pair work their way through a series of gorgeous, never overwrought tunes. Whether from the plains or the prairies, the city or the countryside, one can find something that reminds them of home… and some sense of comfort in the Small Glories‘ music.”BLUEGRASS TODAY
“Luft and Edwards mine a sound drawn directly from a distinct rootsy regimen. With their close knit harmonies and an archival folk-like feel, their music taps into tradition while maintaining its contemporary credence. Now, two albums on, they’ve become a force worth reckoning with, seasoned and spirited all at the same time.”FRONT PORCH MUSIC
“Luft and Edwards compliment one another so perfectly and blend to create a beautiful piece of art… These two could sing the alphabet and turn it into a masterpiece!”GLIDE MAGAZINE
“… ‘Sing’ is a profound soon-to-be anthem of our times, that combines pick-and-holler melodies and directness. Like Patty Griffin and Gillian Welch, The Small Glories bring a sweet idealism and emotive vocals that stick both to the ears and soul.”AMERICANA HIGHWAYS

197,Ma Polaine’s Great Decline,"Described as “like a young Billie Holiday gate-crashing a Tom Waits Swordfishtrombones recording session”, or “a moody Mary Margaret O’Hara”, blues and roots duo MA POLAINE’S GREAT DECLINE continue to build a reputation as an intriguing and hard to pigeon-hole act.This autumn Ma Polaine’s Great Decline release a new single and accompanying video The Poison Sits. This is a remixed ‘single version’ of the song which features on the band’s latest record “The Outsider”. From the start Beth Packer and Clinton Hough always sought to keep their song-writing influences open, and have a sound with oddness, sparsity and a subtle quality that is their own, and this song is perhaps the best example of this. The Poison Sits is of love’s ability to engulf, a stark blues first written in early 2011 and has become a signature song for the band.The album version of The Poison Sits has had wide-spread radio play, including Tom Robinson’s BBC 6 show, Verity Sharp’s Late Junction on BBC Radio 3 and was included in fRoots magazine download, alongside a feature on the band.The duo have been tightening their unique sound whilst remaining decidedly easy and loose with the range of influences they draw from. Blues, jazz and country feature strongly, but what this duo admire most in others is individuality, artists who have been unafraid to be themselves musically and in attitude. Billie Holiday, Tom Waits, Nina Simone, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Gillian Welch and Nick Cave are just a few examples.This year came the release of a new album, The Outsider which has had widespread radio play and fantastic reviews. 2016’s EP release Small Town Talk gained rave media reviews, building on 2015’s nomination as an emerging artist in the British Blues Awards for the album “Got Me Out Of Hell”, also winning a Reveal Records emerging act competition, and earning an international song-writing semi-final spot for Suffer It Well from 2013 EP of the same name.Throughout this year Ma Polaine’s Great Decline toured the country, taking in the finest of intimate venues and enjoyed a busy festival season at the likes of Green Man and Purbeck Valley Folk Festival.“The Outsider” Review quotesfRoots: “think a moody Mary Margaret O’Hara…”Fatea Magazine: “…a record of profound maturity”…” Beth has a voice of rare beauty; dynamic, vibrant, sultry and, at times, pulsating”…” The Outing is an album to be relished, the aural delights proffered are plentiful and compelling, with a mark of individuality that is refreshing.Roots Music Report: “one compelling and unique musical presence”.Liverpool Sound and Vision: “The Outsider is a series of continuing brilliance to which cannot be contained or pigeon holed”.Folking.com: “If you’ve ever felt that the whole world is cross-threaded, The Outsider is your kind of record”Blues in Britain: “haunting and compelling”.Blues Matters: “it is Beth with her stark and crystal clear vocals that underpins this sound”.",GREEN NOTE,Fri 10th January 8:30pm,£ 11.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLIDX3nwbsI']"

201,Sam Baker,"SAM BAKER makes people happy. The characters in his songs face many challenges – alcoholism, car wrecks, racism, drug addiction, a mother’s abandonment – but they persevere. Much like Sam himself.In 1986 Sam got in the middle of someone else’s war. When a terrorist bomb exploded in his train compartment, he went from being a young, healthy, tourist enjoying Peru with friends to a broken man surrounded by death and dying. Given his injuries, he too should have died. But through a series of miracles and coincidences he survived.There were lots of surgeries, and the requisite pain pills. His leg was saved by a successful femoral arterial graft. When the cranial bleed in his brain healed, he had to relearn nouns, and after his right eardrum was replaced, he regained some hearing. With the top of his left hand gone, it seemed that his formerly skilful hands had been transformed into blocks of wood, but eventually those hands learned how to play an upside-down guitar.Physically, Sam was recovering, but his life was filled with pills, booze, and rage. Then came the voices and messengers that helped him see that the greatest gift is life itself. He learned about forgiveness. He needed to tell his story. Songs started to come from that upside-down guitar. Before he knew it, there were CDs, tours around the world, an interview with Terry Gross, and awards in Rolling Stone.Sam feels compelled to tell his story – through his music, art, or any means possible – to one person at a time, or to thousands from a festival stage.A Sam Baker show is a celebration. Some songs tell of everyday people who survive life’s daily challenges; others are stories of growing up in a small Texas prairie town. All his shows are an acknowledgement and appreciation of the pure joy that comes with people gathering to listen to live music. Sam’s fans travel to see him, often driving hours to experience the powerful performance. After the show, they tell Sam their stories. At the end of the day, we all go in peace.“Simultaneously beautiful and broken… Sam Baker is an artist worth waiting for” – NPR All Things Considered“The Bard of the Workaday World” – Wall Street Journal“Maybe the most captivating songwriter in America.” – Lone Star Music
Praise for Land of Doubt:With a sound both soaring and sad, the Texas-based Baker sings in a raspy talk-whisper that makes you stop what you’re doing, sit down and listen. —Scott Stroud, The Associated PressIn some ways, more a poet than a musician, Baker paints vivid pictures with often simple phrases.  Baker somehow simultaneously sounds both tough as nails and fragile as glass… Peter Blackstock, The Austin American StatesmanSam Baker has reached a career high with ‘Land of Doubt’; it’s an album, a complete piece of work and one of the most beautiful pieces of art you will hear all year.”—Penny Black, UK ",THE WATER RATS,Tue 11th February 8:00pm,£ 17.00,"['https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DFmcAcKta8']"
202,"Joni, Sandy & Me – Sally Barker with Anna Ryder","In this new show ‘Sandy, Joni & Me’ SALLY BARKER and ANNA RYDER are delighted to bring some of the songs of both Joni Mitchell and Sandy Denny to the stage, exploring the singer/songwriter legacy that was forged in the early ’70s.Veteran folk-blues singer/songwriter Sally Barker (lead vocal, guitars & percussion) became Tom Jones’ finalist on The Voice UK 2014 after reducing her mentor, and many watching the tv, to tears with her performances.
